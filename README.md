# Doing_Some_DataScience_with_python
Data science turns out to be one of the hottest fields nowadays. With this project we will showcase some data oriented approaches( that can be significant to small sized companies) by exploring an end-to-end data science project cycle using python. 

BAsic outline:
   - Some data extraction..
   - Data processing and visualization
   - Build, evaluate, and fine-tuning a predictive model.
   - Offering the model as API for a real-time manipulation.
