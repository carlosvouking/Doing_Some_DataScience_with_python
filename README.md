# Doing_Some_DataScience_with_python
Data science turns out to be one of the hottest fields nowadays. In this project we will be producing data oriented evidences that can be significant for companies by exploring an end-to-end data science project cycle using python. 

Outline:
   - Some data extraction..
   - Data processing and visualization
   - Build, evaluate, and fine-tuning a predictive model.
   - Offering the model as API for a real-time manipulation.
